\usage{
set_flash_data(Y, init = c("softimpute", "mean"), noise_type = c("constant",
  "known", "Bayes_var", "var_col", "noisy", "noisy_col"), sigmae2_tilde = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{an n by p data matrix}
}
\value{
a flash data object
}
\details{
Y can have missing data, but no column or row can be entirely missing
The flash data object contains flags for dealing with missing data
and a (naively) imputed version of the original data matrix so that
i) some of the initializatinon methods used by flash (eg svd) do not fail
ii) data$Y * data$missing is 0 if the original data were missing
